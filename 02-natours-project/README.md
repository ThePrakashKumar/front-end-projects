This project is part of [Jonas Schmedtmann's](https://codingheroes.io/) course [Advance CSS and SASS](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/). There is no JavaScript involved in this project, everything is done by only HTML and CSS/SASS. In this project I get to learn about `clip-path`, how can we have a gradient over an image, text which has gradient color, how we can creating rotating cards, some best practice, how we can render different size of image on different devices for fast load, CSS animation and much more.
